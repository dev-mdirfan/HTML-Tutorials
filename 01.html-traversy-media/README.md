# HTML By Traversy YT Media

- No Prior Knowledge.
- Start from beginning (This is for beginners).
- Little to no CSS (In this Video).
- We will focus on HTML5 only.
- Slide and examples
- Be patient:
  - You are not gonna learn HTML in just 5 or 10 minutes - absolute bullshit
  - If you're going to be a web developer you have to be patient.
- Enjoy Learning:
  - You have to really enjoy learning even you land a good job you're going to learning every single day.
  - If you're that impatient where you can't watch an hour long course then you probably wrong profession.
